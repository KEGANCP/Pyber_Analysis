# Pyber Analysis

## Project Overview
V. Isualize, CEO of Pyber (a rideshare company) has enlisted my expertise with compiling data utilizing [city data](https://github.com/KEGANCP/Pyber_Analysis/blob/main/Resources/city_data.csv) and [ride data](https://github.com/KEGANCP/Pyber_Analysis/blob/main/Resources/ride_data.csv) from preceding rides. Upon presenting my initial data visualizations comparing ride data between Rural, Urban, and Suburban locations, I was tasked to provide further visuals comparing this data within a set timeframe.

## Analysis Results
Utilizing the below dataframe, we can conlcude while Urban areas have the most "Total Rides", and "Total Drivers", they have both the lowest "Average Fare Per Ride", and "Average Fare Per Driver".

While reviewing the data within a more concise timeframe of a few months, as shown below, we can conclude Urban areas consistenly brought in the most fares, which can be seen on the y axis of the graph, while the x axis shows correlating months. This view makes it easy to confirm our findings seemingly stay consistent.
