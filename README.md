# Pyber Analysis

## Project Overview
V. Isualize, CEO of Pyber (a rideshare company) has enlisted my expertise with compiling data utilizing [city data](https://github.com/KEGANCP/Pyber_Analysis/blob/main/Resources/city_data.csv) and [ride data](https://github.com/KEGANCP/Pyber_Analysis/blob/main/Resources/ride_data.csv) from preceding rides. Upon presenting my initial data visualizations comparing ride data between Rural, Urban and Suburban locations, I was tasked to provide further visuals comparing these locations within a set timeframe.
