# Pyber Analysis

## Project Overview
V. Isualize, CEO of Pyber (a rideshare company) has enlisted my expertise with compiling data utilizing [city data](https://github.com/KEGANCP/Pyber_Analysis/blob/main/Resources/city_data.csv) and [ride data](https://github.com/KEGANCP/Pyber_Analysis/blob/main/Resources/ride_data.csv) from preceding rides. Upon presenting my initial data visualizations comparing ride data between Rural, Urban, and Suburban locations, I was tasked to provide further visuals comparing this data within a set timeframe.

## Analysis Results
Utilizing the below dataframe, we can conlcude while Urban areas have the most "Total Rides", and "Total Drivers", they have both the lowest "Average Fare Per Ride", and "Average Fare Per Driver".

While reviewing the data within a more concise timeframe of a few months, as shown below, we can conclude Urban areas consistenly brought in the most fares, which can be seen on the y axis of the graph, while the x axis shows correlating months. This view makes it easy to confirm our findings seemingly stay consistent.

## Project Summary
We can culminate the following from our analysis:
- Urban areas generate the most revenue.
- Urban areas have the most available ride share occupants and drivers alike.
- While rural areas generate the highest fare average per driver, they only provide just over 5% of the total rides utilized in this data.

I would recommend further analysis to show more trends within each area. Upon viewing the "Pyber Summary Visual" you can see a potential trend beginning toward the end of April where revenue for rural area's are decreasing while revenue within suburban areas are increasing. This could be a result of many factors, but appropriate planning could be implemented to limit the loss of revenue overall by considering a fare increase in the suburban areas. Within the same image you can see a clear increase in revenue across all three areas around the end of February, Pyber can capitlize on this data. If there are determining factors for this increase in the need for ridesharing, a ride fare increase during this time could provide a great increase in revenue. Another thought, based on this data, the low quantity of total rides within rural areas could be a result of a number of things, but something to consider is lowering the cost per fare in this area in efforts to receive more potential business, as well as divers.
